# user-journey-tracker
A MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application with TypeScript that tracks and visualises user journeys on a shopping platform. The system records key user events e.g. session start time, pages/items visited, purchase count, time spent on pages, and provides searchable insights for individual users.
